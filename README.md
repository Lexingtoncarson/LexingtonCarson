### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Lexingtoncarson/LexingtonCarson** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...Graphic Design and Coding 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...Coding 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...Creative Work 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...Coding 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...through my email (lcarson20@students.ndc.edu)
-->
I am still learning, but I thought to make this account to help express my creativity and to put my work out there. 
I am looking to make a personal website based around Graphic Design and Advertising. This Graphic Design and Advertising may be based around fashion or travel. 
Since I am still open to many new things my Graphic Design and Advertising interest are not limited to these two areas.
